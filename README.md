**Goals and Objectives:** 

**Motivation**: To predict human age and genders based on images provided to a machine learning model. The primary motivation behind the project is to aid in designing a good model that predicts human age and gender. This can be used to create filters implemented on various platforms.

**Significance**: The project can be of a lot of significance as it can be deployed in many real-life apps such as Snapchat, Instagram, and other social platforms. This can also be used in other applications involving human image gender and age prediction.

**Objectives**: The main objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict the age and gender of human face images depending on previous data. 

**Features**: We use image recognition techniques and deal with image processing techniques taking into account facial features such as finding patterns in human facial data that distinguish genders and also taking features such as wrinkles and skin aging as a factor to design an age prediction model.
